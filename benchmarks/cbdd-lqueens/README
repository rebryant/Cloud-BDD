This directory is used for generating and tabulating the n-queens
benchmarks, based on a construction that starts with the bottom row
and adds constraints layer-by-layer up to the top.

Usage:

1. Make sure the runbdd program in the direction ../ is compiled.

2. Generate lqueens command files in the directory ../scripts.
   (See the README.txt file in that directory)

3. Run the program ./lqrun.py to execute the command files.
   E.g., for just the 15-queens benchmarks, run: ./lqrun.py -n 15 -N 15 

4. Use "make move" to copy the results into directories according to
   values of n.

5. Run "make all" to tabulate the results
