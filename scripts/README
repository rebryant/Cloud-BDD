Used in TACAS 2018 paper

circuit.py: A (crufty) program for generating Boolean command files

lqueen.py: Generate constraints for the n-queens problem by generating
	   the constraints starting from the bottom row and working upward

	   Run './lqueen -a' to generate 240 benchmark files for
	   	   variants of n-queens ranging from n = 4 to n = 16

Not used in TACAS 2018 paper

nqueen.py: Generate constraints for the n-queens problem by generating
	   a bunch of constraints and AND'ing them together.

addassoc.py: Creates tests comparing (a+b)+c to a+(b+c)

multassoc.py: Creates tests comparing (a*b)*c to a*(b*c)

multiplier.py: Generate n-bit multipliers
